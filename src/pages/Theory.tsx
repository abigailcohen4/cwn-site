        <h1>Theoretical Analysis</h1>
        <p>Community Wireless Networks (CWNs) broaden internet access through an implementation of internet infrastructure alternative to that of traditional Internet Service Providers in both technical and social ways. Mechanisms of this infrastructure present democracy and proximity as essentials for internet access. These principles guide the mesh network topology most CWNs implement and demonstrate a potential for propagation into the social realm. 
Through an application of Langdon Winner's theory of technological politics (1980), I will lay out potential social implications of CWNs. As Winner asserts, technology materializes a specific relationship to power. Technological politics may take on one of two forms: the technology being a method of resolving an issue or the technology being particularly compatible with a power system (Ibid, 123). The first form asserts that modern machines may be implemented to enhance or enforce a privilege system. A machine's design enables this by producing outcomes logically related to its execution (Ibid, 125). The second form describes technology that grants a “justification for authority,” as it operates best with a specific power structure (Ibid, 130).  
In this explanation, I will inspect artifacts, physical objects or features with a specific purpose, and techniques, abstract methods whose manifested implementation may vary (Dafoe 2015, 1051). In this exploration, CWNs' artifacts subscribe to the first form, while its techniques subscribe to the second.

<h3>Artifacts </h3>
<ol> 
  <li><strong>IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi) Protocol and Line of Sight. </strong>Alternatively to predominant wired internet infrastructure, CWNs implement a wireless network to connect their community. To construct a wireless network, routers are strategically placed to enable a line of sight between each other. 
  One's signal will be stronger the more routers within line of sight, but one only needs a connection to one router to connect to the network. A wireless router uses IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi) protocol to transmit data to all nodes within its scope. Any node with an unobstructed view will receive its signal. 
  With this artifact, CWNs transform areas of inadequate internet service to a web of invisible connections. Applying LOS to this problem communicates the significance of community interdependence. Speaking and listening to individuals in proximity, as their routers do, can solve a community-wide problem and establish support systems. A wireless network motivates interpersonal networks to take their shape; once routers are installed, neighbors may communicate about the routers' maintenance as their internet access depends on one another's router. 
  Further, an individual seeking to join the network who is slightly beyond the scope may initiate a conversation with a neighbor between themself and the nearest router-supporting building. Instead of outsourcing network connectivity issues to the ISP, CWN members look to each other for solutions. 
  A wireless network may inspire interpersonal networks to take their shape. </li>
  <li><strong>Power over Ethernet. </strong>Routers are installed along the wall or on the rooftop of buildings to enable line of sight. T
  his placement complicates the issue of powering a router. In response, CWNs like Philly Community Wireless and NYC Mesh commonly use routers able to be powered over ethernet ports (Philly Community Wireless; NYC Mesh). 
  Ethernet was designed to support wired Internet access. At its release, the only way to access the Internet was plugging an ethernet cable from the ethernet port to one's computer. With the widespread adoption of Wi-Fi, ethernet ports' necessity has significantly declined, 
  leaving many ports unused. In 2000, Power over Ethernet introduced a mechanism to deliver DC power over Category 5 cable. This feature transformed an increasingly obsolete hardware to a support for a wide range of tools. CWN members witnessing PoE device installations may begin to notice other unseen features within their building or community. Adaptations of obsolete or ignored features can extend to physical sites—from an abandoned lot to a community garden—and social spaces—from a school to a parent-teacher association.

<h3>Techniques </h3>
<li><strong>Mesh Network Topology. </strong>CWNs commonly implement a mesh network topology to connect their community. A mesh network is a decentralized network in which each node connects to multiple other nodes. An individual's Internet signal will be stronger and more resilient if their neighbors have routers, too. This topology enables a more reliable connection than a star topology, in which each node connects to a central hub. Star topology resembles a hierarchical power structure, while mesh topology distributes Wi-Fi sources evenly throughout a network. 
Distributed mesh nodes substantiate a political system of decentralized power. Though some devices perform more functions than others, each device can serve as one's entry point into the network. By design, CWN members do not serve one centralized power; in fact, concentration of Wi-Fi on one node slows down Internet traffic for all connections to that node, making centralization inefficient. Mesh networks dynamically self-organize, as routers chart their own internetwork paths. As such, it grants intercommunity traffic freedom to determine their own connections. 
If one wanted to desist from their CWN, they could create another one, simply with the installation of another high site, a strong wireless connection from an ISP. This flexibility makes enforcing a dominant authority difficult. A mesh topology coheres with a system that values decentralization and individual choice.
